# -Perception-and-Behaviour-Coordination
In developing an autonomous car controller in a simulated environment, I enhanced its capabilities to detect and respond to traffic lights.  while maintaining its existing behavior of moving forward, staying on the road, and taking random turns at junctions. This integration ensures safety and driving behavior.
